# URGENT: Blog Auto-Publishing Fix Required

## Critical Issue Identified (September 9, 2025)

### ❌ GitHub Actions Scheduled Workflows Are COMPLETELY BROKEN

**Testing Results:**
- Set workflow to run every minute (`* * * * *`)
- Waited 5+ minutes
- **ZERO scheduled runs triggered**
- Only manual workflow_dispatch triggers work
- Last successful scheduled run: September 5, 2025

### Confirmed Issues:
1. GitHub Actions scheduled cron triggers are NOT working for this repository
2. This affects ALL scheduled workflows, not just blog publishing
3. Manual triggers (`workflow_dispatch`) work perfectly
4. The workflow code itself is correct and functional

## Immediate Workaround Solutions

### Option 1: Manual Daily Publishing (Current Solution)
Run this command daily at 9 AM EST:
```bash
# From your local machine
gh workflow run publish-blog.yml

# OR use the check script
./scripts/check-and-publish.sh
```

### Option 2: External Cron Service (Recommended)
Use a free external cron service to trigger the workflow:

1. **cron-job.org** (Free)
   - Sign up at https://cron-job.org
   - Create job with URL: `https://api.github.com/repos/HustleHarder86/Investing/actions/workflows/publish-blog.yml/dispatches`
   - Method: POST
   - Headers: 
     - `Authorization: token YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN`
     - `Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json`
   - Body: `{"ref":"main"}`
   - Schedule: Daily at 14:00 UTC (9 AM EST)

2. **GitHub Personal Access Token**
   - Go to GitHub Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens
   - Create token with `repo` and `workflow` permissions
   - Use in the cron service authorization header

### Option 3: Vercel Cron Jobs
Since the site is hosted on Vercel, use Vercel's cron jobs:

1. Create `/api/publish-blog/route.ts`:
```typescript
export async function GET() {
  const response = await fetch(
    'https://api.github.com/repos/HustleHarder86/Investing/actions/workflows/publish-blog.yml/dispatches',
    {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `token ${process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN}`,
        'Accept': 'application/vnd.github.v3+json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ ref: 'main' }),
    }
  );
  
  return Response.json({ 
    success: response.ok,
    triggered: new Date().toISOString() 
  });
}
```

2. Add to `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "crons": [{
    "path": "/api/publish-blog",
    "schedule": "0 14 * * *"
  }]
}
```

### Option 4: Local Cron (If you have always-on machine)
Add to your local crontab:
```bash
# Edit crontab
crontab -e

# Add this line (adjust path to your repo)
0 9 * * * cd /path/to/investing && gh workflow run publish-blog.yml
```

## Testing Performed

1. **Test Post Created**: `test-auto-publish.tsx`
2. **Schedule Set**: Every minute (`* * * * *`)
3. **Wait Time**: 5+ minutes
4. **Result**: ZERO scheduled triggers
5. **Manual Trigger**: Worked immediately
6. **Conclusion**: GitHub Actions scheduling is broken

## Action Items

### Immediate (Today):
- [x] Document the issue
- [x] Create manual publishing script
