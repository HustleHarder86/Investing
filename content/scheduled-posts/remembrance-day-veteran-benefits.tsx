const blogFAQs = [
  {
    question: "How much do I need to retire comfortably in the GTA?",
    answer: "Retirement needs vary, but GTA retirees typically require 60-70% of pre-retirement income in 2025. With average Toronto housing costs, a couple needs $75,000-$100,000 annually for comfortable retirement, or $50,000-$65,000 if mortgage-free. Using the 4% withdrawal rule, this requires $1.25-2.5 million in savings. Government benefits (CPP, OAS) provide about $30,000-40,000 per couple, meaning personal savings must generate $35,000-70,000 annually. Healthcare, travel, and inflation significantly impact these figures."
  },
  {
    question: "When should I convert my RRSP to a RRIF?",
    answer: "You must convert RRSPs to RRIFs by December 31 of the year you turn 71, but can convert earlier for strategic reasons in 2025. Early conversion provides income flexibility and pension income splitting at 65. However, RRIF withdrawals are mandatory (5.28% at 71, increasing annually to 20% at 95), while RRSPs allow withdrawal control. Consider early conversion if you need regular income, want to income split, or have large RRSPs that will trigger OAS clawback. Delay if you have other income sources and want maximum tax deferral."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I minimize taxes in retirement?",
    answer: "Strategic tax planning can save retirees thousands annually. Key strategies include: TFSA maximization ($7,000/year, tax-free growth), pension income splitting (up to 50% with spouse), timing RRSP/RRIF withdrawals to smooth tax brackets, delaying CPP/OAS if you have other income, using dividend tax credits from non-registered investments, and managing income to avoid OAS clawback (starts at $86,912 in 2025). Consider professional tax planning - the savings often exceed advisory fees by 5-10x."

const relatedQuestions = [
  {
    question: "What are the tax implications of financial planning?",
    answer: "Tax implications of financial planning vary based on your specific situation and income level. In Ontario, factors like your marginal tax rate, the type of transaction, and timing can significantly impact your tax liability. It's essential to consult with a qualified financial advisor or tax professional who can analyze your unique circumstances and help you optimize your tax strategy. They can identify available deductions, credits, and planning opportunities specific to GTA residents."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does the financial planning process take?",
    answer: "The financial planning timeline varies depending on complexity, the professionals involved, and specific circumstances. Simple cases might resolve in 3-6 months, while complex situations involving multiple parties, valuations, or negotiations can take 12-18 months or longer. Working with experienced financial advisors familiar with GTA regulations can help streamline the process and avoid unnecessary delays. Early planning and proper documentation are key to expediting matters."
  },
  {
    question: "What professionals should I consult for financial planning?",
    answer: "For financial planning, you'll likely need a team of professionals including a Certified Financial Planner (CFP¬Æ), tax accountant, and legal counsel specializing in your specific needs. Depending on your situation, you might also benefit from business valuators, real estate appraisers, or pension specialists. Choose professionals with experience in the Greater Toronto Area who understand local regulations and market conditions. Look for credentials, client testimonials, and specific expertise in your area of need."
  },
  {
    question: "What are common mistakes in financial planning?",
    answer: "Common mistakes in financial planning include acting without professional advice, making emotional rather than strategic decisions, overlooking tax implications, failing to document agreements properly, and not considering long-term consequences. Many people also underestimate costs, miss important deadlines, or fail to update their financial plans after major life changes. Working with experienced GTA financial advisors helps avoid these costly errors and ensures you're making informed decisions based on current regulations and best practices."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does professional financial planning advice cost?",
    answer: "Professional financial planning advice costs vary based on complexity, services required, and the advisor's experience. Financial planners may charge hourly rates ($200-500), flat fees for specific services ($2,500-10,000), or ongoing asset management fees (1-2% annually). While costs may seem significant, professional guidance often saves money through tax optimization, avoiding costly mistakes, and identifying opportunities you might miss. Many GTA advisors offer initial consultations to discuss your needs and provide transparent fee structures."

      Master Corporal James Thompson served three tours in Afghanistan, but his toughest battle came after 
      returning home to Toronto in 2019. "I knew how to lead a platoon through Kandahar," he told me, his 
      service dog Duke resting quietly beside him, "but I had no idea how to navigate Veterans Affairs Canada." 
      Like thousands of Canadian veterans, James was entitled to substantial financial benefits ‚Äì disability 
      awards, rehabilitation services, education funding, and career transition support ‚Äì worth potentially 
      hundreds of thousands of dollars. Yet the complexity of applications, medical assessments, and overlapping 
      programs left him overwhelmed and underserved for nearly two years. It wasn't until his wife Sarah found 
      specialized help that they discovered James was entitled to $4,200 monthly in disability benefits, $40,000 
      in education funding, and priority hiring for federal positions. As we approach Remembrance Day 2025, 
      with over 600,000 veterans across Canada and 95,000 in the Greater Toronto Area alone, understanding and 
      accessing veteran benefits has never been more critical. This comprehensive guide honors our servicemen 
      and women by ensuring they receive every dollar of support they've earned through their sacrifice.

      Understanding Your Service Connection

      The foundation of veteran benefits lies in establishing service connection ‚Äì proving that injuries,

      or training, mental health conditions like PTSD, and even conditions that developed or worsened during 
      service. The key is thorough documentation and understanding VAC's assessment process.

      Honoring Service Through Action
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      This Remembrance Day, we honor our veterans not just with ceremonies and poppies, but by ensuring they 
      receive every benefit they've earned. Too many veterans like James Thompson struggle unnecessarily, 
      unaware of their entitlements or overwhelmed by bureaucracy.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-8">
      Remember, these benefits aren't charity ‚Äì they're compensation for service, sacrifice, and in many cases, 
      ongoing suffering. Whether you served in Afghanistan, Bosnia, or peacekeeping missions, whether you're 
      dealing with physical injuries or invisible wounds, support is available.
