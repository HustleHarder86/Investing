  {
    question: "What severance am I entitled to in Ontario?",
    answer: "Ontario employment law provides two types of severance: minimum statutory (1 week per year up to 8 weeks under ESA) and common law reasonable notice (often 1 month per year of service, up to 24 months) in 2025. Factors affecting common law severance include age, position, length of service, and job market conditions. Senior executives over 50 with 10+ years often receive 18-24 months. Always have an employment lawyer review packages - initial offers average only 30-50% of potential entitlements."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I maximize Employment Insurance (EI) benefits?",
    answer: "EI provides 55% of average insurable earnings up to $68,500 (2025 maximum $650/week) for 14-45 weeks depending on regional unemployment and hours worked. Apply immediately upon job loss - delays can cost benefits. You can earn up to 50% of benefits through part-time work without reduction. Training programs may extend benefits. Severance payments don't affect eligibility but may delay start date. Report job search activities accurately - false reporting leads to penalties and repayment."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I take a lump sum or salary continuance severance?",
    answer: "Lump sum provides immediate access to funds and certainty, allowing investment and avoiding employer bankruptcy risk in 2025. However, it triggers immediate tax withholding (often 30-40%) and may push you into a higher tax bracket. Salary continuance maintains benefits, spreads tax burden, and preserves potential for additional severance if you find work, but ties you to employer policies and restricts legal claims. Most financial advisors recommend lump sum for packages over 12 months, salary continuance for shorter periods."

      The tech industry's boom-and-bust cycle hit a dramatic inflection point in 2025. After the 
      massive hiring sprees of 2020-2022, Greater Toronto Area tech companies have announced over 
      15,000 layoffs since January 2024. From Shopify to smaller startups, no company seems immune. 
      If you're facing a tech sector layoff, understanding your severance rights and optimizing your 
      financial transition strategy has never been more critical.

      Understanding Your Severance Entitlements

      The Three Layers of Severance in Ontario
    </h3>
    
    <p className="mb-4">
      Many tech workers don't realize they have three potential sources of severance compensation:
    </p>

    <ol className="space-y-4 text-gray-700 mb-8">
      <li>
        <strong>1. Employment Standards Act (ESA) Minimums:</strong> The legal floor, not ceiling. 
        One week per year of service up to 8 weeks maximum. This is just the starting point.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2. Common Law Reasonable Notice:</strong> Based on case law, typically 2-4 weeks per 
        year of service, potentially up to 24 months for senior positions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>3. Contractual Entitlements:</strong> What your employment contract specifies, which 
        may limit or enhance common law rights.
      </li>
    </ol>

      Tech-Specific Compensation Components
    </h3>
    
    <p className="mb-4">
      Tech severance isn't just about base salary. Your package should include:
    </p>

    <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-8">
      <li><strong>Base salary continuation:</strong> The foundation of your package</li>
      <li><strong>Bonus proration:</strong> Don't leave earned bonuses on the table</li>
      <li><strong>RSU/Stock option treatment:</strong> Acceleration or extended exercise windows</li>
      <li><strong>Benefits continuation:</strong> Critical for families and pre-existing conditions</li>
      <li><strong>RRSP matching:</strong> Often overlooked but valuable</li>
      <li><strong>Professional development:</strong> Course reimbursements and certifications</li>

      The Art of Severance Negotiation
    </h2>

    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-3">
      When to Negotiate (Hint: Always)
    </h3>
    
    <p className="mb-6">
      Research shows that 67% of tech workers who negotiate their severance receive 50-100% more than 
      the initial offer. Yet only 38% attempt negotiation. Don't be part of the silent majority.
    </p>

    <div className="bg-yellow-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-600 p-6 mb-8">
      <h3 className="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Timing Alert</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
        You typically have 5-10 business days to review and sign a severance agreement. Use this time wisely:
      </p>
      <ul className="space-y-2 text-gray-700">
        <li><strong>Day 1-2:</strong> Don't sign anything. Process the shock.</li>
        <li><strong>Day 3-4:</strong> Consult an employment lawyer (most offer free consultations)</li>
        <li><strong>Day 5-7:</strong> Negotiate through your lawyer or directly</li>
        <li><strong>Day 8-10:</strong> Finalize improved package</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-3">
      Negotiation Leverage Points
    </h3>
    
    <p className="mb-4">
      Tech workers often have more leverage than they realize:
    </p>

    <ol className="space-y-4 text-gray-700 mb-8">
      <li>
        <strong>1. Specialized Knowledge:</strong> Your deep understanding of proprietary systems makes 
        you valuable even in exit. Negotiate consulting arrangements.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2. Non-Compete Concerns:</strong> If they want you to sign a non-compete, that's worth 
        additional compensation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>3. Timing Factors:</strong> Layoffs before bonuses, RSU vesting, or promotion cycles 
        strengthen your position.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>4. Age and Re-employment Challenges:</strong> Workers over 45 in tech face longer job 
        searches, justifying enhanced packages.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>5. Induced Employment:</strong> If you were recruited from a stable position, you may 
        be entitled to more.

      Stock Options and RSUs: The Hidden Value
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      For many tech workers, equity compensation represents 20-50% of total compensation. Don't let 
      it evaporate with your layoff.

      Conclusion: Turning Crisis into Opportunity
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Tech layoffs in 2025 are undeniably challenging, but they're not career-ending. With proper 
      severance negotiation, tax planning, and transition strategies, many tech workers emerge stronger 
      and better compensated than before.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      The key is acting strategically, not emotionally. Take the time to understand your rights,
