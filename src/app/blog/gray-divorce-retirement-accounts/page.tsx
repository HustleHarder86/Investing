const blogFAQs = [
  {
    question: "How are assets divided in an Ontario divorce?",
    answer: "Ontario follows equalization of net family property, meaning spouses share equally in the increase of their net worth during marriage in 2025. Each spouse calculates their net worth on the marriage date and separation date. The spouse with the higher increase pays half the difference to the other. The matrimonial home is treated specially - its full value is included regardless of who owned it before marriage. Excluded assets include inheritances, gifts from third parties, and personal injury settlements."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens to RRSPs and pensions during divorce?",
    answer: "RRSPs accumulated during marriage are divided equally, typically through a tax-free rollover to the other spouse's RRSP in 2025. Defined benefit pensions require actuarial valuation to determine present value, which forms part of equalization. You can transfer up to 50% of pension credits to your spouse tax-free. CPP credits earned during marriage are automatically split equally upon divorce. TFSAs are treated as regular property for equalization purposes."
  },
  {
    question: "How is spousal support calculated in Ontario?",
    answer: "Spousal support uses the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines, which consider income difference, marriage length, ages, and children in 2025. For marriages over 20 years or age 65+, support is often indefinite. The formula typically ranges from 1.5-2% of income difference per year of marriage (without children) to more complex calculations with children. High-income earners ($350,000+) may see different applications. Tax implications are significant - support is deductible for the payor and taxable for the recipient."

      At 58, Margaret thought she was approaching retirement with security and dignity. Thirty-two years 
      of marriage, a combined retirement portfolio worth $2.8 million, and plans to travel the world with 
      her husband. Then came the conversation that changed everything: divorce. "I went from planning 
      Mediterranean cruises to calculating if I could afford to keep the lights on," she told me through 
      tears. "How did half of everything become not nearly enough?" Margaret's story reflects a harsh 
      reality: gray divorce—separation after age 50—has doubled since 1990, and the financial implications 
      are particularly devastating for retirement security. With less time to recover financially and 
      retirement assets often representing the bulk of marital wealth, dividing these accounts properly 
      can mean the difference between comfortable retirement and financial struggle.

      The financial impact is compounded by timing: there's simply less opportunity to rebuild retirement 
      savings when divorce occurs near or during retirement years. Understanding how to protect and divide 
      retirement assets becomes crucial for survival, not just comfort.
