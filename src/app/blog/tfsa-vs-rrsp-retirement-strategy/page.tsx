  {
    question: "How much do I need to retire comfortably in the GTA?",
    answer: "Retirement needs vary, but GTA retirees typically require 60-70% of pre-retirement income in 2025. With average Toronto housing costs, a couple needs $75,000-$100,000 annually for comfortable retirement, or $50,000-$65,000 if mortgage-free. Using the 4% withdrawal rule, this requires $1.25-2.5 million in savings. Government benefits (CPP, OAS) provide about $30,000-40,000 per couple, meaning personal savings must generate $35,000-70,000 annually. Healthcare, travel, and inflation significantly impact these figures."
  },
  {
    question: "When should I convert my RRSP to a RRIF?",
    answer: "You must convert RRSPs to RRIFs by December 31 of the year you turn 71, but can convert earlier for strategic reasons in 2025. Early conversion provides income flexibility and pension income splitting at 65. However, RRIF withdrawals are mandatory (5.28% at 71, increasing annually to 20% at 95), while RRSPs allow withdrawal control. Consider early conversion if you need regular income, want to income split, or have large RRSPs that will trigger OAS clawback. Delay if you have other income sources and want maximum tax deferral."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I minimize taxes in retirement?",
    answer: "Strategic tax planning can save retirees thousands annually. Key strategies include: TFSA maximization ($7,000/year, tax-free growth), pension income splitting (up to 50% with spouse), timing RRSP/RRIF withdrawals to smooth tax brackets, delaying CPP/OAS if you have other income, using dividend tax credits from non-registered investments, and managing income to avoid OAS clawback (starts at $86,912 in 2025). Consider professional tax planning - the savings often exceed advisory fees by 5-10x."

const quickAnswer = "Choose TFSAs for retirement if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket now than in retirement, or if you want to avoid OAS clawback. Choose RRSPs if you're in a high tax bracket now (over $100,000 income) and expect lower income in retirement. Most GTA professionals benefit from maximizing both.";

      Sarah Chen, a 32-year-old marketing director in downtown Toronto, sat across from her twin brother Michael 
      at a Yorkville caf√©, both equally confused. "I max out my RRSP every year," Sarah said, showing her 
      $18,000 annual contribution. "But I put everything in my TFSA," Michael countered, proud of his $7,000 
      yearly deposits. Plot twist: they're both wrong ‚Äì and both right. Despite identical $95,000 salaries, 
      their different life situations mean opposite strategies make sense. Sarah, with her employer's 50% RRSP 
      matching and plans for a year-off sabbatical, benefits most from RRSP contributions. Michael, saving for 
      a downtown condo while starting his own business, needs his TFSA's flexibility. With Canadians now having 
      access to $95,000 in TFSA room (if you've been eligible since 2009) and average unused RRSP room hitting 
      $75,000, the TFSA versus RRSP decision has never been more critical ‚Äì or more misunderstood. This guide 
      breaks down the optimal strategy for every age and income level, helping GTA residents make the smartest 
      choice for their unique situation.

      The Fundamental Difference That Changes Everything
    </h3>

    <p className="mb-6">
      While both accounts shelter investment growth from taxes, they work in opposite ways. RRSPs give you a 
      tax deduction today but tax you on withdrawal. TFSAs offer no deduction but tax-free withdrawals forever. 
      This seemingly simple difference creates dramatically different outcomes based on your age, income, and 
      retirement plans.

      The TFSA versus RRSP decision isn't about choosing one perfect account ‚Äì it's about using both 
      strategically throughout your financial journey. Young Torontonians should prioritize TFSA flexibility 
      while capturing employer matching. Mid-career professionals should maximize RRSP tax savings.
