      The 2025 federal budget has introduced significant changes to how inherited assets are taxed in Canada, 
      with the capital gains inclusion rate increasing from 50% to 66.67% for gains exceeding $250,000. 
      For Ontario families planning their estates, understanding these changes is critical to preserving wealth 
      for the next generation.

      Key Changes for 2025: What You Need to Know
    </h2>
    
    <p className="mb-6">
      The most impactful change affects high-value estates, particularly those with significant capital 
      property such as secondary homes, investment portfolios, and business assets. Here&apos;s what&apos;s changing:
    </p>

      <ul className="space-y-2 text-gray-700">
        <li>• Capital gains inclusion rate increases to 66.67% for gains over $250,000</li>
        <li>• First $250,000 of capital gains remains at 50% inclusion rate</li>
        <li>• Principal residence exemption remains unchanged</li>
        <li>• Lifetime capital gains exemption for qualified small business shares increases to $1,016,836</li>

      Impact on Common Inheritance Scenarios
    </h2>

    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-3">
      1. Cottage and Secondary Properties
    </h3>
    
    <p className="mb-4">
      For many Ontario families, the cottage represents both cherished memories and significant tax liability. 
      With GTA cottage prices averaging $800,000-$1.5 million, the new inclusion rate can dramatically 
      increase the tax burden on estates.
    </p>

    <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-8">
      <h4 className="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Example: Muskoka Cottage Inheritance</h4>
      <ul className="space-y-2 text-gray-700">
        <li><strong>Purchase Price (1995):</strong> $200,000</li>
        <li><strong>Fair Market Value (2025):</strong> $1,200,000</li>
        <li><strong>Capital Gain:</strong> $1,000,000</li>
        <li><strong>Tax Under Old Rules:</strong> ~$135,000</li>
        <li><strong>Tax Under New Rules:</strong> ~$180,000</li>
        <li><strong className="text-red-600">Additional Tax Burden:</strong> $45,000</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-3">
      2. Investment Portfolios
    </h3>
    
    <p className="mb-4">
      Non-registered investment accounts face similar challenges. Toronto professionals who&apos;ve built 
      substantial portfolios outside their RRSPs and TFSAs need to consider the tax implications for 
      their beneficiaries.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Strategic planning opportunities include:
    </p>

    <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-8">
      <li>Crystallizing gains before death through planned dispositions</li>
      <li>Using spousal rollovers to defer taxation</li>
      <li>Implementing prescribed rate loans for income splitting</li>
      <li>Converting non-registered investments to insurance products</li>
    </ul>

      Ontario-Specific Considerations
    </h2>

    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-3">
      Probate Fees (Estate Administration Tax)
    </h3>
    
    <p className="mb-4">
      While federal tax changes grab headlines, Ontario&apos;s probate fees remain a significant cost. 
      Currently set at 1.5% on estates over $50,000, these fees can add thousands to the cost of 
      settling an estate.
    </p>

    <div className="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-600 p-6 mb-8">
      <h3 className="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">💡 Planning Tip</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        Multiple wills remain an effective strategy for Ontario residents. By using a primary will 
        for assets requiring probate and a secondary will for private company shares and personal 
        effects, families can save significant probate fees.

      Strategic Planning Opportunities for 2025
    </h2>

    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-3">
      1. Estate Freeze for Business Owners
    </h3>
    
    <p className="mb-6">
      GTA business owners should consider an estate freeze before the new rules fully impact their 
      succession planning. This strategy locks in today&apos;s values and shifts future growth to the 
      next generation.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-3">
      2. Charitable Giving Strategies
    </h3>
    
    <p className="mb-4">
      With higher tax rates on capital gains, charitable donations become even more attractive. 
      Consider these approaches:
    </p>

    <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-8">
      <li>Donating publicly traded securities directly (zero capital gains tax)</li>
      <li>Establishing a charitable remainder trust</li>
      <li>Using life insurance to fund charitable bequests</li>
      <li>Creating private foundations for family legacy planning</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-3">
      3. Life Insurance as an Estate Planning Tool
    </h3>
    
    <p className="mb-6">
      Permanent life insurance becomes increasingly valuable under the new tax regime. Policies can:
    </p>

    <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-8">
      <li>Provide tax-free funds to pay estate taxes</li>
      <li>Equalize inheritances among beneficiaries</li>
      <li>Preserve cottage properties for the family</li>
      <li>Fund buy-sell agreements for business partners</li>

      Special Considerations for High-Net-Worth Families

      Families with estates exceeding $5 million face particular challenges under the new rules. 
      Advanced strategies become essential:

    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-3">
      Family Trusts
    </h3>
    
    <p className="mb-6">
      While recent changes to trust taxation have reduced some benefits, properly structured family 
      trusts still offer advantages for income splitting and succession planning. The key is working 
      with advisors who understand both the opportunities and limitations.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-3">
      Cross-Border Considerations
    </h3>
    
    <p className="mb-6">
      Many GTA families have U.S. connections through property ownership or family members. The 
      interaction between Canadian and U.S. estate taxes requires careful planning, particularly 
      for estates exceeding the U.S. estate tax exemption of $13.61 million USD per person in 2025.

      Common Mistakes to Avoid
    </h2>

    <ol className="space-y-4 text-gray-700 mb-8">
      <li>
        <strong>1. Focusing solely on tax minimization:</strong> While taxes matter, don&apos;t let the 
        tax tail wag the dog. Family harmony and clear succession planning often matter more than 
        saving the last tax dollar.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2. Neglecting to communicate with beneficiaries:</strong> Surprise inheritances with 
        large tax bills can create family conflict. Have open discussions about estate plans and 
        tax implications.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>3. Failing to update plans regularly:</strong> Tax laws change, as do family circumstances. 
        Review your estate plan at least every three years or after major life events.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>4. DIY estate planning for complex situations:</strong> The new tax rules make professional 
        advice more valuable than ever. The cost of proper planning pales compared to potential tax savings.
