const blogFAQs = [
  {
    question: "How are assets divided in an Ontario divorce?",
    answer: "Ontario follows equalization of net family property, meaning spouses share equally in the increase of their net worth during marriage in 2025. Each spouse calculates their net worth on the marriage date and separation date. The spouse with the higher increase pays half the difference to the other. The matrimonial home is treated specially - its full value is included regardless of who owned it before marriage. Excluded assets include inheritances, gifts from third parties, and personal injury settlements."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens to RRSPs and pensions during divorce?",
    answer: "RRSPs accumulated during marriage are divided equally, typically through a tax-free rollover to the other spouse's RRSP in 2025. Defined benefit pensions require actuarial valuation to determine present value, which forms part of equalization. You can transfer up to 50% of pension credits to your spouse tax-free. CPP credits earned during marriage are automatically split equally upon divorce. TFSAs are treated as regular property for equalization purposes."
  },
  {
    question: "How is spousal support calculated in Ontario?",
    answer: "Spousal support uses the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines, which consider income difference, marriage length, ages, and children in 2025. For marriages over 20 years or age 65+, support is often indefinite. The formula typically ranges from 1.5-2% of income difference per year of marriage (without children) to more complex calculations with children. High-income earners ($350,000+) may see different applications. Tax implications are significant - support is deductible for the payor and taxable for the recipient."

      The September 2025 Toronto real estate market presents a paradox for divorcing couples: home values 
      have stabilized after two years of volatility, but interest rates at 5.25% make buyouts increasingly 
      difficult. Sarah and James, like many GTA couples, discovered their Beaches semi-detached home—purchased 
      for $980,000 in 2019—is now worth $1.4 million. Good news for their net worth, but a nightmare for 
      division. With mortgage qualification rules tightened and inventory at historic lows, the question 
      isn't just "who gets the house?" but "can either of us afford to keep it?" This September market 
      update provides essential insights and strategies for navigating property division in Toronto's 
      unique real estate landscape.

      five years ago, at rates double what they were in 2021.
