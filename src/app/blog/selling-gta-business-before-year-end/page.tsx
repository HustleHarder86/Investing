      As Roberto walked through his Vaughan manufacturing facility one last time this August, he 
      couldn't help but feel overwhelmed. After 22 years building his precision tooling business from 
      a garage startup to a $8 million enterprise employing 45 people, the offer from a US competitor 
      was too good to refuse. But with just four months left in 2025, the difference between closing 
      now versus January could mean $400,000 in tax savings—or losses. For Greater Toronto Area business 
      owners contemplating a sale, the year-end deadline creates both tremendous opportunities and 
      potential pitfalls that require strategic navigation.

      timing. With capital gains inclusion rate changes, the small business deduction threshold at 
      $500,000, and potential tax reform on the horizon, GTA business owners face a complex decision 
      matrix that can significantly impact their after-tax proceeds.

      Conclusion: Your Year-End Action Plan
    </h2>
    
    <p className="mb-6">
      With less than four months remaining in 2025, the window for completing a tax-efficient business 
      sale is narrowing rapidly. The convergence of favorable tax rates, strong buyer demand, and 
      year-end budget cycles creates a compelling case for action.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Remember Roberto from our opening? By implementing an estate freeze, claiming SR&ED credits, 
      and structuring a hybrid sale with vendor financing, he reduced his tax bill by $400,000 while 
      achieving his target sale price. His December closing allowed him to maximize RRSP contributions 
      and begin his retirement planning with confidence.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      The key to success lies in starting immediately, assembling the right team, and maintaining 
      flexibility in negotiations while keeping your tax objectives firmly in sight. Every day counts 
      when racing against the December 31 deadline.
