      Master Corporal James Thompson served three tours in Afghanistan, but his toughest battle came after 
      returning home to Toronto in 2019. "I knew how to lead a platoon through Kandahar," he told me, his 
      service dog Duke resting quietly beside him, "but I had no idea how to navigate Veterans Affairs Canada." 
      Like thousands of Canadian veterans, James was entitled to substantial financial benefits ‚Äì disability 
      awards, rehabilitation services, education funding, and career transition support ‚Äì worth potentially 
      hundreds of thousands of dollars. Yet the complexity of applications, medical assessments, and overlapping 
      programs left him overwhelmed and underserved for nearly two years. It wasn't until his wife Sarah found 
      specialized help that they discovered James was entitled to $4,200 monthly in disability benefits, $40,000 
      in education funding, and priority hiring for federal positions. As we approach Remembrance Day 2025, 
      with over 600,000 veterans across Canada and 95,000 in the Greater Toronto Area alone, understanding and 
      accessing veteran benefits has never been more critical. This comprehensive guide honors our servicemen 
      and women by ensuring they receive every dollar of support they've earned through their sacrifice.

      Understanding Your Service Connection
    </h3>

    <p className="mb-6">
      The foundation of veteran benefits lies in establishing service connection ‚Äì proving that injuries, 
      illnesses, or conditions resulted from military service. This includes physical injuries from combat 
      or training, mental health conditions like PTSD, and even conditions that developed or worsened during 
      service. The key is thorough documentation and understanding VAC's assessment process.

      Honoring Service Through Action
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      This Remembrance Day, we honor our veterans not just with ceremonies and poppies, but by ensuring they 
      receive every benefit they've earned. Too many veterans like James Thompson struggle unnecessarily, 
      unaware of their entitlements or overwhelmed by bureaucracy.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-8">
      Remember, these benefits aren't charity ‚Äì they're compensation for service, sacrifice, and in many cases, 
      ongoing suffering. Whether you served in Afghanistan, Bosnia, or peacekeeping missions, whether you're 
      dealing with physical injuries or invisible wounds, support is available.
    </p>
