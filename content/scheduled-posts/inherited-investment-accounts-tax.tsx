        When David inherited his mother's investment portfolio—including $400,000 in RRSPs, $150,000 in TFSAs, and $300,000 in non-registered accounts—he thought his financial worries were over. Six months later, a $180,000 tax bill and improper account transfers had cost him nearly 30% of his inheritance. His story illustrates a harsh reality: inheriting investment accounts without understanding the tax implications can destroy wealth faster than poor market returns.

        <p className="text-blue-900 font-semibold mb-2">The Investment Inheritance Maze</p>
        <p className="text-blue-800">
          Each type of investment account faces different tax treatment at death. What works for TFSAs can trigger massive taxes for RRSPs. Understanding these distinctions before inheriting—or better yet, during estate planning—can save hundreds of thousands in unnecessary taxes.

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">The Tax Treatment Hierarchy: Not All Accounts Are Equal</h2>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Canada's tax system treats inherited investment accounts dramatically differently based on registration type, beneficiary designation, and relationship to the deceased. Understanding this hierarchy is essential for both estate planning and inheritance management.

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">Tax-Free Savings Accounts (TFSAs): The Gold Standard</h3>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        TFSAs offer the most favorable inheritance treatment, but only if properly structured. The account value transfers tax-free to beneficiaries, but what happens next depends on beneficiary designation.

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Beyond basic tax treatment, inherited investment accounts come with numerous pitfalls that can destroy wealth if not properly navigated.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">Trap 1: The Attribution Rules Nightmare</h3>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Transferring investments to lower-income family members during life triggers attribution rules, but these cease at death. This creates planning opportunities but also complexity:
      </p>

      <ul className="space-y-3 mb-8 text-gray-700">
        <li>• Income attribution stops at death for spousal transfers</li>
        <li>• Capital gains attribution also ceases</li>
        <li>• Minor children can now earn investment income without attribution</li>
        <li>• Opportunity to restructure family investments tax-efficiently</li>

        <p className="text-red-800">
          US stocks held directly (not through Canadian mutual funds or ETFs) may trigger US estate tax for estates over $60,000 USD. A $500,000 portfolio of US stocks could face 40% US estate tax plus Canadian taxes. Always hold US investments through Canadian-listed funds or in RRSPs for treaty protection.
