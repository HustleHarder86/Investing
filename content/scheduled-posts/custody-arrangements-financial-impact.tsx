const blogFAQs = [
  {
    question: "How are assets divided in an Ontario divorce?",
    answer: "Ontario follows equalization of net family property, meaning spouses share equally in the increase of their net worth during marriage in 2025. Each spouse calculates their net worth on the marriage date and separation date. The spouse with the higher increase pays half the difference to the other. The matrimonial home is treated specially - its full value is included regardless of who owned it before marriage. Excluded assets include inheritances, gifts from third parties, and personal injury settlements."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens to RRSPs and pensions during divorce?",
    answer: "RRSPs accumulated during marriage are divided equally, typically through a tax-free rollover to the other spouse's RRSP in 2025. Defined benefit pensions require actuarial valuation to determine present value, which forms part of equalization. You can transfer up to 50% of pension credits to your spouse tax-free. CPP credits earned during marriage are automatically split equally upon divorce. TFSAs are treated as regular property for equalization purposes."
  },
  {
    question: "How is spousal support calculated in Ontario?",
    answer: "Spousal support uses the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines, which consider income difference, marriage length, ages, and children in 2025. For marriages over 20 years or age 65+, support is often indefinite. The formula typically ranges from 1.5-2% of income difference per year of marriage (without children) to more complex calculations with children. High-income earners ($350,000+) may see different applications. Tax implications are significant - support is deductible for the payor and taxable for the recipient."

const relatedQuestions = [
  {
    question: "What are the tax implications of financial planning?",
    answer: "Tax implications of financial planning vary based on your specific situation and income level. In Ontario, factors like your marginal tax rate, the type of transaction, and timing can significantly impact your tax liability. It's essential to consult with a qualified financial advisor or tax professional who can analyze your unique circumstances and help you optimize your tax strategy. They can identify available deductions, credits, and planning opportunities specific to GTA residents."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does the financial planning process take?",
    answer: "The financial planning timeline varies depending on complexity, the professionals involved, and specific circumstances. Simple cases might resolve in 3-6 months, while complex situations involving multiple parties, valuations, or negotiations can take 12-18 months or longer. Working with experienced financial advisors familiar with GTA regulations can help streamline the process and avoid unnecessary delays. Early planning and proper documentation are key to expediting matters."
  },
  {
    question: "What professionals should I consult for financial planning?",
    answer: "For financial planning, you'll likely need a team of professionals including a Certified Financial Planner (CFP®), tax accountant, and legal counsel specializing in your specific needs. Depending on your situation, you might also benefit from business valuators, real estate appraisers, or pension specialists. Choose professionals with experience in the Greater Toronto Area who understand local regulations and market conditions. Look for credentials, client testimonials, and specific expertise in your area of need."
  },
  {
    question: "What are common mistakes in financial planning?",
    answer: "Common mistakes in financial planning include acting without professional advice, making emotional rather than strategic decisions, overlooking tax implications, failing to document agreements properly, and not considering long-term consequences. Many people also underestimate costs, miss important deadlines, or fail to update their financial plans after major life changes. Working with experienced GTA financial advisors helps avoid these costly errors and ensures you're making informed decisions based on current regulations and best practices."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does professional financial planning advice cost?",
    answer: "Professional financial planning advice costs vary based on complexity, services required, and the advisor's experience. Financial planners may charge hourly rates ($200-500), flat fees for specific services ($2,500-10,000), or ongoing asset management fees (1-2% annually). While costs may seem significant, professional guidance often saves money through tax optimization, avoiding costly mistakes, and identifying opportunities you might miss. Many GTA advisors offer initial consultations to discuss your needs and provide transparent fee structures."

      "I thought 50/50 custody meant no child support," David Chen said, staring at his financial statement 
      showing $2,400 monthly payments despite equal parenting time. His ex-wife Lisa earned $65,000 as a 
      teacher while David's tech sales role brought in $145,000. Their three children – ages 8, 12, and 14 – 
      split time equally between their Markham home and Lisa's Scarborough townhouse. Yet David discovered 
      that shared custody doesn't mean shared costs when there's income disparity. Between child support, 
      Section 7 expenses for hockey and tutoring, maintaining two child-ready homes, and the hidden costs of 
      constant transitions, their "amicable" custody arrangement was costing David $58,000 annually – far more 
      than the full-custody support he'd initially feared. This financial shock reverberates across the GTA, 
      where custody arrangements dramatically impact not just children's lives but parents' financial futures. 
      With Ontario's child support guidelines, tax implications, and extraordinary expenses creating a complex 
      web of obligations, understanding the true cost of different custody models becomes essential for 
      financial planning. This comprehensive guide reveals how custody decisions translate into decades of 
      financial commitments and how to structure arrangements that protect both children's needs and parents' 
      financial stability.

      The 40% Threshold: Why Every Day Counts
    </h3>

    <p className="mb-6">
      In Ontario, the magic number is 40% – or 146 days annually. Once a parent has children 40% of the time, 
      child support calculations shift from the simple table amount to a complex set-off formula. This can 
      reduce support obligations by 30-50%, making the difference between 39% and 40% worth thousands monthly.
