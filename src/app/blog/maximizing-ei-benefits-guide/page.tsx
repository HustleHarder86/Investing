  {
    question: "How are EI benefits calculated in 2025?",
    answer: "EI regular benefits pay 55% of your average insurable earnings up to the 2025 maximum of $68,500 annually, providing maximum weekly benefits of $668. Benefits are calculated using your best 14-22 weeks of earnings (depending on regional unemployment rate) in the last 52 weeks. You need 420-700 insurable hours to qualify, with higher unemployment regions requiring fewer hours. Benefits last 14-45 weeks based on hours worked and regional unemployment. The Toronto region typically requires 665 hours for 19 weeks of benefits. Special benefits (maternity, parental) have different calculations and durations."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I work while receiving EI benefits?",
    answer: "Yes, you can work while on EI using the Working While on Claim provision, keeping 50 cents of EI benefits for every dollar earned, up to 90% of previous weekly earnings in 2025. Earnings above this threshold are deducted dollar-for-dollar from benefits. You must report all earnings in the week you earn them, not when paid. Self-employment income, including gig work, must be reported. Training and schooling are allowed if approved by Service Canada. Working helps maintain skills, extend benefit duration, and can lead to full-time employment without penalty for ending your claim early."
  },
  {
    question: "What disqualifies you from receiving EI benefits?",
    answer: "EI disqualification occurs for voluntarily leaving without just cause, misconduct leading to dismissal, refusing suitable employment, not being available for work, or providing false information in 2025. Just cause includes harassment, dangerous conditions, significant pay reduction (20%+), or employer breach of contract. Misconduct means willful actions incompatible with employment, not poor performance. You must be actively seeking work, document job search efforts, and be available for work Monday-Friday. Severance payments may delay but not disqualify benefits. Penalties for false claims include repayment, fines up to $5,000, and prosecution."
  }

const keyTakeaways = [
  "Maximum EI benefit is $668/week for up to 45 weeks in 2025",
  "Need 420-700 insurable hours depending on regional unemployment rate",

  "New tax rules and contribution limits apply for 2025",

];

const relatedQuestions = [
  {
    question: "What are the tax implications of EI benefits?",
    answer: "Tax implications of EI benefits vary based on your specific situation and income level. In Ontario, factors like your marginal tax rate, the type of transaction, and timing can significantly impact your tax liability. It's essential to consult with a qualified financial advisor or tax professional who can analyze your unique circumstances and help you optimize your tax strategy. They can identify available deductions, credits, and planning opportunities specific to GTA residents."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does the EI benefits process take?",
    answer: "The EI benefits timeline varies depending on complexity, the professionals involved, and specific circumstances. Simple cases might resolve in 3-6 months, while complex situations involving multiple parties, valuations, or negotiations can take 12-18 months or longer. Working with experienced financial advisors familiar with GTA regulations can help streamline the process and avoid unnecessary delays. Early planning and proper documentation are key to expediting matters."
  },
  {
    question: "What professionals should I consult for EI benefits?",
    answer: "For EI benefits, you'll likely need a team of professionals including a Certified Financial Planner (CFP®), tax accountant, and legal counsel specializing in your specific needs. Depending on your situation, you might also benefit from business valuators, real estate appraisers, or pension specialists. Choose professionals with experience in the Greater Toronto Area who understand local regulations and market conditions. Look for credentials, client testimonials, and specific expertise in your area of need."
  },
  {
    question: "What are common mistakes in EI benefits?",
    answer: "Common mistakes in EI benefits include acting without professional advice, making emotional rather than strategic decisions, overlooking tax implications, failing to document agreements properly, and not considering long-term consequences. Many people also underestimate costs, miss important deadlines, or fail to update their financial plans after major life changes. Working with experienced GTA financial advisors helps avoid these costly errors and ensures you're making informed decisions based on current regulations and best practices."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does professional EI benefits advice cost?",
    answer: "Professional EI benefits advice costs vary based on complexity, services required, and the advisor's experience. Financial planners may charge hourly rates ($200-500), flat fees for specific services ($2,500-10,000), or ongoing asset management fees (1-2% annually). While costs may seem significant, professional guidance often saves money through tax optimization, avoiding costly mistakes, and identifying opportunities you might miss. Many GTA advisors offer initial consultations to discuss your needs and provide transparent fee structures."

const quickAnswer = "To maximize EI benefits in 2025, apply immediately after job loss, ensure your ROE shows maximum insurable earnings ($66,300), and avoid any actions that could delay your claim. You can receive up to $668 per week for 14-45 weeks depending on your region's unemployment rate and hours worked.";

      When Marcus received his Record of Employment after 12 years with a Bay Street firm, he thought 
      applying for EI would be straightforward. "I paid into it for over a decade," he reasoned, "how 
      complicated could it be?" Three weeks later, sitting across from me in our Toronto office, he was 
      overwhelmed. His claim was delayed due to severance allocation issues, he didn't understand why his 
      benefits were less than expected, and he'd accidentally jeopardized his claim by taking on consulting 
      work without proper reporting. Marcus's story isn't unique—in 2025, with new EI rules and enhanced 
      benefits, thousands of Ontario workers are leaving money on the table simply because they don't 
      understand the system. This guide will ensure you're not one of them.
