const blogFAQs = [
  {
    question: "How are assets divided in an Ontario divorce?",
    answer: "Ontario follows equalization of net family property, meaning spouses share equally in the increase of their net worth during marriage. Each spouse calculates their net worth on the marriage date and separation date. The spouse with the higher increase pays half the difference to the other. The matrimonial home is treated specially - its full value is included regardless of who owned it before marriage. Excluded assets include inheritances, gifts from third parties, and personal injury settlements."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens to RRSPs and pensions during divorce?",
    answer: "RRSPs accumulated during marriage are divided equally, typically through a tax-free rollover to the other spouse's RRSP. Defined benefit pensions require actuarial valuation to determine present value, which forms part of equalization. You can transfer up to 50% of pension credits to your spouse tax-free. CPP credits earned during marriage are automatically split equally upon divorce. TFSAs are treated as regular property for equalization purposes."
  },
  {
    question: "How is spousal support calculated in Ontario?",
    answer: "Spousal support uses the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines, which consider income difference, marriage length, ages, and children. For marriages over 20 years or age 65+, support is often indefinite. The formula typically ranges from 1.5-2% of income difference per year of marriage (without children) to more complex calculations with children. High-income earners ($350,000+) may see different applications. Tax implications are significant - support is deductible for the payor and taxable for the recipient."

      When Jennifer and Mark sat in my Toronto office last month, they thought dividing their 
      retirement accounts would be straightforward. "We'll just split everything 50-50," Mark said 
      confidently. But when I explained that their $400,000 RRSP would trigger an immediate $120,000 
      tax bill if handled incorrectly, while their $200,000 TFSA could be divided tax-free, they 
      realized the complexity ahead. In 2025, with new pension legislation and evolving case law in 
      Ontario, understanding the nuanced differences between RRSP and TFSA division has never been 
      more critical for divorcing couples in the Greater Toronto Area.

      The Fundamental Difference: Why RRSPs and TFSAs Aren't Equal in Divorce
    </h2>
    
    <p className="mb-6">
      While both RRSPs and TFSAs are registered accounts designed to help Canadians save for the future, 
      they're treated dramatically differently during divorce proceedings. The distinction isn't just 
      academic‚Äîit can mean tens of thousands of dollars in unexpected taxes or lost retirement security.

      RRSP Division: The Tax Trap Waiting to Happen
    </h3>
    
    <p className="mb-4">
      RRSPs represent pre-tax dollars. Every dollar withdrawn triggers income tax at your marginal rate, 
      which in Toronto often exceeds 40% for professionals. During divorce, couples have two main options:
    </p>

    <ol className="space-y-4 text-gray-700 mb-8">
      <li>
        <strong>1. Tax-Free Rollover:</strong> Transfer directly to spouse's RRSP or new Spousal RRSP 
        under Section 146(16) of the Income Tax Act. No immediate tax, but the receiving spouse pays 
        tax on eventual withdrawal.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2. Cash Withdrawal:</strong> Withdraw funds and pay the spouse their share. This triggers 
        immediate taxation at your marginal rate, plus potential early withdrawal penalties.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-3">
      TFSA Division: The Simpler Solution
    </h3>
    
    <p className="mb-6">
      TFSAs contain after-tax dollars, making division significantly cleaner. Withdrawals are tax-free, 
      and the contribution room is restored the following calendar year. However, timing matters 
      significantly for maximizing both parties' contribution room.

    <p className="mb-6">
      Spousal RRSPs add another layer of complexity that catches many Toronto couples off guard. 
      These accounts, where one spouse contributes but the other owns the funds, have special 
      attribution rules that survive separation.

      The Equalization Payment Alternative
    </h3>
    
    <p className="mb-4">
      Instead of dividing retirement accounts directly, consider these alternatives:
    </p>

    <ol className="space-y-4 text-gray-700 mb-8">
      <li>
        <strong>1. Property Offset:</strong> Trade RRSP value against home equity. With Toronto homes 
        averaging $1.2 million, there's often room for creative solutions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2. Support Payment Structure:</strong> Use monthly spousal support instead of lump-sum 
        RRSP division, maintaining tax deductibility.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>3. Pension Split:</strong> For those over 65, pension income splitting rules may provide 
        better tax outcomes than division.

      <li>
        <strong>4. Time-Delayed Division:</strong> Agreement to divide at retirement when tax rates may 
        be lower.
