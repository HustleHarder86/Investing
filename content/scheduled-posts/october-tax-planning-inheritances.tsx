      When Sarah inherited $1.8 million from her aunt's estate in April 2025, she thought the hard part 
      was over once probate cleared. But sitting in our Mississauga office last week, she realized that 
      without strategic year-end planning, she could face an unnecessary $85,000 tax bill come April 2026. 
      October marks the critical planning window for inheritance recipients‚Äîwith just three months until 
      year-end, every tax-saving strategy must be evaluated and implemented now. The 2025 tax landscape, 
      featuring increased capital gains inclusion rates and new reporting requirements, makes proactive 
      October planning essential for anyone who's received an inheritance this year.

      Understanding Your Inheritance Tax Position
    </h2>
    
    <p className="mb-6">
      Canada doesn't have an inheritance tax, but that doesn't mean inheritances are tax-free. The tax 
      implications depend entirely on what you inherited and what you do with it. October is the perfect 
      time to assess your situation and implement strategies before the December 31 deadline.
    </p>

    <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-600 p-6 mb-8">
      <h3 className="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">üí∞ Tax Treatment by Asset Type</h3>
      <ul className="space-y-2 text-gray-700">
        <li>‚Ä¢ <strong>Cash:</strong> Tax-free receipt, but investment income taxable going forward</li>
        <li>‚Ä¢ <strong>Real Estate:</strong> Stepped-up cost base, future gains taxable</li>

      The October Advantage: Why Timing Matters
    </h2>
    
    <p className="mb-6">
      October provides the sweet spot for tax planning‚Äîenough time to implement complex strategies but 
      with urgency to drive decision-making. Many tax-saving opportunities have strict year-end deadlines, 
      and October allows for proper execution without the December rush when professionals are overwhelmed.
    </p>

    <div className="bg-amber-50 border-l-4 border-amber-600 p-6 mb-8">
      <h3 className="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">üìÖ Critical Year-End Deadlines</h3>
      <ul className="space-y-2 text-gray-700">
        <li>‚Ä¢ <strong>October 31:</strong> Tax-loss selling orders should be placed</li>
        <li>‚Ä¢ <strong>November 30:</strong> Trust distributions must be decided</li>
        <li>‚Ä¢ <strong>December 15:</strong> Final date for complex reorganizations</li>
        <li>‚Ä¢ <strong>December 27:</strong> Last settlement date for capital gains/losses</li>
        <li>‚Ä¢ <strong>December 31:</strong> RRSP contributions, charitable donations deadline</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      Strategic Move #1: Maximize Tax-Loss Harvesting
    </h2>
    
    <p className="mb-6">
      If you inherited a portfolio with embedded losses or have losses in your existing holdings, October 
      is the time to crystallize them. With the capital gains inclusion rate now at 66.67% for gains over 
      $250,000, offsetting gains has become even more valuable.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Consider David, who inherited $500,000 in bank stocks and sold them in July for a $60,000 gain. 
      By reviewing his existing portfolio in October, we identified $40,000 in unrealized losses. Selling 
      these positions before year-end will save him approximately $8,000 in taxes while allowing him to 
      repurchase similar (but not identical) investments after 30 days.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Superficial Loss Rules</h3>
    <p className="mb-6">
      Be careful of the superficial loss rules when tax-loss selling. You cannot claim a loss if you or 
      your spouse repurchase the same security within 30 days before or after the sale. October timing 
      allows you to wait out this period and still repurchase before year-end if desired.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      Strategic Move #2: Optimize Charitable Giving
    </h2>
    
    <p className="mb-6">
      Inheritances often inspire charitable giving, and October is ideal for maximizing tax benefits. 
      Donating appreciated securities directly to charity eliminates capital gains tax while providing 
      a donation receipt for full market value.
    </p>

    <div className="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-600 p-6 mb-8">
      <h3 className="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">üéÅ Charitable Giving Strategies</h3>
      <ul className="space-y-2 text-gray-700">
        <li>‚Ä¢ <strong>Direct Security Donation:</strong> Eliminate capital gains on appreciated stocks</li>
        <li>‚Ä¢ <strong>Donor-Advised Funds:</strong> Get immediate deduction, decide charities later</li>
        <li>‚Ä¢ <strong>Private Foundation:</strong> For inheritances over $5 million</li>
        <li>‚Ä¢ <strong>Charitable Remainder Trust:</strong> Income for life, charity gets remainder</li>
        <li>‚Ä¢ <strong>Flow-Through Shares:</strong> 100% deduction plus charity donation</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      Strategic Move #3: Income Splitting with Family
    </h2>
    
    <p className="mb-6">
      October provides time to establish proper income-splitting structures. While attribution rules 
      prevent simple transfers to lower-income family members, legitimate strategies exist for sharing 
      the tax burden of inheritance-generated income.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Prescribed Rate Loans</h3>
    <p className="mb-6">
      With the CRA prescribed rate at 6% (Q4 2025), lending inheritance funds to a spouse or family trust 
      can still generate tax savings if investment returns exceed this rate. October setup ensures a full 
      quarter of income splitting before year-end.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Family Trust Structures</h3>
    <p className="mb-6">
      For larger inheritances, October allows time to establish a family trust before year-end. Income 
      can be allocated to lower-income beneficiaries, potentially saving thousands in taxes annually. 
      The trust can also provide creditor protection and estate planning benefits.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      Strategic Move #4: RRSP and TFSA Optimization
    </h2>
    
    <p className="mb-6">
      Inherited funds provide the opportunity to maximize registered account contributions. October planning 
      ensures you don't miss valuable contribution room and can strategically time contributions for 
      maximum benefit.
    </p>

    <div className="bg-indigo-50 border-l-4 border-indigo-600 p-6 mb-8">
      <h3 className="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">üìä 2025 Contribution Limits</h3>
      <ul className="space-y-2 text-gray-700">
        <li>‚Ä¢ <strong>TFSA:</strong> $7,000 annual limit (cumulative room since 2009: $95,000)</li>
        <li>‚Ä¢ <strong>RRSP:</strong> 18% of 2024 income, max $31,560</li>
        <li>‚Ä¢ <strong>FHSA:</strong> $8,000 annual limit for first-time buyers</li>
        <li>‚Ä¢ <strong>RESP:</strong> $2,500 per child for maximum grant</li>
        <li>‚Ä¢ <strong>Spousal RRSP:</strong> Use your room, spouse gets deduction</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      Strategic Move #5: Real Estate Decisions
    </h2>
    
    <p className="mb-6">
      If you inherited real estate, October is decision time. Holding costs, market conditions, and tax 
      implications all factor into whether to keep, sell, or restructure ownership before year-end.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Principal Residence Designation</h3>
    <p className="mb-6">
      You can only have one principal residence at a time. If you inherited a home and already own one, 
      October analysis should determine which property to designate for the exemption. Consider future 
      appreciation potential, current unrealized gains, and lifestyle preferences.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Rental Property Conversion</h3>
    <p className="mb-6">
      Converting inherited property to rental use triggers a deemed disposition. October provides time to 
      obtain proper valuations and potentially elect under subsection 45(2) to defer the gain for up to 
      four years.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      Strategic Move #6: Investment Portfolio Restructuring
    </h2>
    
    <p className="mb-6">
      Inherited investment portfolios often don't align with your risk tolerance or tax situation. October 
      allows for thoughtful restructuring before year-end, balancing tax efficiency with investment goals.
    </p>

    <div className="bg-gray-50 border-l-4 border-gray-600 p-6 mb-8">
      <h3 className="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">üíº Portfolio Optimization Tactics</h3>
      <ul className="space-y-2 text-gray-700">
        <li>‚Ä¢ Review asset location (which accounts hold which investments)</li>
        <li>‚Ä¢ Consider tax-efficient funds and ETFs over mutual funds</li>
        <li>‚Ä¢ Evaluate corporate class funds for non-registered accounts</li>
        <li>‚Ä¢ Implement systematic withdrawal plans for steady income</li>
        <li>‚Ä¢ Use return of capital investments to defer taxation</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      Strategic Move #7: Estate Freeze Considerations
    </h2>
    
    <p className="mb-6">
      For those who inherited significant wealth, October is the time to consider your own estate planning. 
      An estate freeze can lock in today's values for tax purposes while allowing future growth to accrue 
      to the next generation.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      This strategy is particularly relevant given potential tax changes in 2026. October implementation 
      allows time for proper valuations, legal documentation, and CRA advance ruling requests if needed.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      Avoiding Common October Planning Mistakes
    </h2>
    
    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Mistake 1: Rushing Decisions</h3>
    <p className="mb-6">
      While October creates urgency, avoid making hasty decisions. Take time to model different scenarios 
      and understand long-term implications. A wrong decision made quickly can cost more than missing a 
      year-end deadline.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Mistake 2: Ignoring Provincial Differences</h3>
    <p className="mb-6">
      Tax rates and rules vary by province. If you inherited assets in multiple provinces or are considering 
      relocating, October is the time to understand interprovincial tax implications.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Mistake 3: Forgetting About AMT</h3>
    <p className="mb-6">
      The Alternative Minimum Tax can surprise inheritance recipients, especially with large capital gains 
      or donation tax credits. October planning should include AMT calculations to avoid unexpected tax bills.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      Special Situations Requiring October Action
    </h2>
    
    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Inherited RRSPs/RRIFs</h3>
    <p className="mb-6">
      Non-spouse beneficiaries face full taxation on inherited registered accounts. October planning can 
      explore options like pension income splitting (if eligible), RRSP contributions to offset the income, 
      or strategic timing of withdrawals if the estate is still open.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Foreign Inheritances</h3>
    <p className="mb-6">
      Inherited foreign assets require October attention for T1135 reporting requirements, foreign tax 
      credit optimization, and potential treaty benefits. The complexity often requires professional help 
      to navigate correctly.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Business Interests</h3>
    <p className="mb-6">
      Inherited private company shares need October evaluation for potential reorganizations, dividend 
      payments, or sales before year-end. The lifetime capital gains exemption might apply, but planning 
      is required to qualify.
    </p>

      Working with Professionals: The October Imperative
    </h2>
    
    <p className="mb-6">
      October is peak season for tax professionals, so book appointments immediately. Come prepared with 
      documentation, specific questions, and clear goals. The cost of professional advice typically pays 
      for itself many times over in tax savings.

      The difference between proactive October planning and reactive April filing can be tens of thousands
