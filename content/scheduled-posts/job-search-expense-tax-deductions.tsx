        When Thomas lost his finance position in downtown Toronto and relocated to Calgary for a new opportunity, he assumed his $15,000 in job search and moving expenses were just the cost of transition. His accountant recovered $6,500 through strategic tax deductions he never knew existed. Most Canadian job seekers leave thousands on the table simply because they don't know what's deductible.

        <p className="text-blue-900 font-semibold mb-2">Tax Savings Reality Check</p>
        <p className="text-blue-800">
          The average job seeker in the GTA spends $8,000-12,000 during career transition. With proper documentation and knowledge, 30-40% of these costs can generate tax deductions or credits, potentially saving $2,000-4,000.

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Understanding Employment-Related Tax Deductions</h2>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Canada's tax system provides several deductions and credits for employment-related expenses, but the rules are specific and often misunderstood. Unlike the United States, Canada doesn't allow general job search expense deductions, but strategic planning can still yield significant tax savings.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">The Foundation: Employment Expenses vs. Job Search Expenses</h3>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        The CRA distinguishes between expenses incurred while employed versus those during job search. This distinction is crucial for maximizing your deductions:

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Moving Expenses: Your Biggest Deduction Opportunity</h2>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        If you relocate at least 40 kilometers closer to a new job, moving expenses become your most valuable deduction. This applies whether moving within the GTA or across Canada.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">Qualifying for Moving Expense Deductions</h3>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        The 40-kilometer rule is measured by the shortest usual public route, not "as the crow flies." Moving from Toronto to Mississauga might qualify, while moving within Toronto typically doesn't.
      </p>

      <div className="bg-yellow-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-400 p-6 mb-8">
        <p className="text-yellow-900 font-semibold mb-2">Critical Timing Element</p>
        <p className="text-yellow-800">
          You can only deduct moving expenses against employment income from your new location. If you move in December but don't start work until January, you'll claim the deduction in the following tax year. Unused amounts can be carried forward.
