      When Jennifer and Mark sat in my Toronto office last month, they thought dividing their 
      retirement accounts would be straightforward. "We'll just split everything 50-50," Mark said 
      confidently. But when I explained that their $400,000 RRSP would trigger an immediate $120,000 
      tax bill if handled incorrectly, while their $200,000 TFSA could be divided tax-free, they 
      realized the complexity ahead. In 2025, with new pension legislation and evolving case law in 
      Ontario, understanding the nuanced differences between RRSP and TFSA division has never been 
      more critical for divorcing couples in the Greater Toronto Area.

      The Fundamental Difference: Why RRSPs and TFSAs Aren't Equal in Divorce
    </h2>
    
    <p className="mb-6">
      While both RRSPs and TFSAs are registered accounts designed to help Canadians save for the future, 
      they're treated dramatically differently during divorce proceedings. The distinction isn't just 
      academic‚Äîit can mean tens of thousands of dollars in unexpected taxes or lost retirement security.

      <ul className="space-y-2 text-gray-700">
        <li>‚Ä¢ <strong>RRSPs:</strong> Considered property under Ontario Family Law Act, subject to equalization</li>
        <li>‚Ä¢ <strong>TFSAs:</strong> Also property, but with different tax implications on division</li>
        <li>‚Ä¢ <strong>Valuation Date:</strong> Both valued at date of separation, not divorce</li>
        <li>‚Ä¢ <strong>Growth After Separation:</strong> Generally excluded from division</li>
        <li>‚Ä¢ <strong>Locked-in Accounts:</strong> LIRAs and LIFs have additional restrictions</li>

      RRSP Division: The Tax Trap Waiting to Happen
    </h3>
    
    <p className="mb-4">
      RRSPs represent pre-tax dollars. Every dollar withdrawn triggers income tax at your marginal rate, 
      which in Toronto often exceeds 40% for professionals. During divorce, couples have two main options:
    </p>

    <ol className="space-y-4 text-gray-700 mb-8">
      <li>
        <strong>1. Tax-Free Rollover:</strong> Transfer directly to spouse's RRSP or new Spousal RRSP 
        under Section 146(16) of the Income Tax Act. No immediate tax, but the receiving spouse pays 
        tax on eventual withdrawal.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2. Cash Withdrawal:</strong> Withdraw funds and pay the spouse their share. This triggers 
        immediate taxation at your marginal rate, plus potential early withdrawal penalties.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-3">
      TFSA Division: The Simpler Solution
    </h3>
    
    <p className="mb-6">
      TFSAs contain after-tax dollars, making division significantly cleaner. Withdrawals are tax-free, 
      and the contribution room is restored the following calendar year. However, timing matters 
      significantly for maximizing both parties' contribution room.
