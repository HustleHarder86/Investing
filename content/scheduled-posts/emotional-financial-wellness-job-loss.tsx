    question: "How do I protect my finances during the emotional stress of job loss?",
    answer: "Create an immediate financial triage plan: calculate exact monthly expenses, inventory all income sources (severance, EI, savings), prioritize essential expenses, and temporarily reduce discretionary spending. Avoid making major financial decisions (like early RRSP withdrawals) while emotionally distressed. Set up automatic bill payments to prevent missed payments during the emotional adjustment period. Consider speaking with a financial advisor who understands job loss dynamics to maintain perspective and avoid costly emotional decisions that could impact long-term financial security."
  },
  {
    question: "What mental health resources are available for Toronto job loss situations?",
    answer: "Toronto offers several resources: Employee and Family Assistance Programs (EFAP) often continue 30-90 days post-termination, OHIP covers basic mental health services, many employers provide career transition counseling, community health centers offer sliding-scale therapy, and organizations like the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) provide support. Many GTA libraries also offer free career transition workshops and job search support. Don't overlook the emotional impact - professional counseling can prevent financial mistakes and accelerate career recovery."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I maintain financial discipline while dealing with job loss anxiety?",
    answer: "Establish structured financial routines: weekly budget reviews, automated savings transfers, and regular check-ins with accountability partners or advisors. Create separate 'emotional spending' allowance ($50-100/week) for minor comfort purchases while protecting larger financial goals. Focus on what you can control: networking activities, skill development, interview preparation. Avoid retail therapy, expensive coping mechanisms, or impulse financial decisions. Consider free/low-cost stress relief like library resources, community programs, or exercise to manage anxiety without financial impact."

        When David, a senior executive at a Bay Street firm, received his termination notice after 15 years, his first thought wasn't about money—it was "Who am I without this job?" Three months later, panic-driven financial decisions had cost him $50,000 in unnecessary losses. His story illustrates a critical truth: the emotional impact of job loss directly affects financial outcomes. Understanding this connection is essential for navigating career transition successfully.

        <h4 className="font-semibold text-blue-900 mb-3">From Crisis to Calling</h4>
        <p className="text-blue-800 mb-4">
          Sarah, 48, lost her VP role at a Toronto bank. After six months of depression and therapy, she launched a financial literacy nonprofit. Today, she earns 80% of her former salary but reports 200% life satisfaction. "Job loss forced me to face who I really was beyond the title."
        </p>
        
        <h4 className="font-semibold text-blue-900 mb-3 mt-6">The Unexpected Pivot</h4>
        <p className="text-blue-800">
          Marcus, terminated from his Mississauga tech job, used his severance for coding bootcamp while managing depression with professional help. He now works remotely for a Silicon Valley startup, earning 30% more. "The emotional work was harder than learning to code, but both were necessary."

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Your Path Forward: Integration and Growth</h2>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Job loss will always be part of your story, but it doesn't define your future. By acknowledging the emotional journey, protecting your financial well-being during vulnerable times, and accessing appropriate support, you can emerge stronger, clearer, and often in a better position than before.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Remember: seeking help isn't weakness—it's strategic. Just as you wouldn't navigate complex tax law without an accountant, don't navigate the emotional complexity of job loss without support. Your financial future depends on your emotional wellness today.
