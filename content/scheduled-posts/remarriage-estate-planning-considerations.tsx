      At 58, Patricia Wong thought she had estate planning figured out. Her $3.2 million estate would be 
      divided equally among her three adult children from her first marriage. Then she met Robert at a 
      charity gala in Yorkville, and everything changed. Two years later, as they planned their wedding, 
      Patricia discovered the shocking truth about remarriage and estate law in Ontario: without careful 
      planning, Robert could inherit everything, leaving her children with nothing. "My kids were furious 
      when they learned he'd automatically get the house and could claim half the estate," Patricia told me, 
      her voice shaking. "They thought I was choosing him over them." This family crisis echoes across the 
      GTA, where 67% of second marriages involve children from previous relationships and average estates 
      exceed $1.5 million. The collision of love, money, and family loyalty creates a legal and emotional 
      minefield that standard estate planning can't navigate. With Ontario's spousal rights, dependent relief 
      claims, and the Family Law Act creating overlapping and sometimes contradictory obligations, remarriage 
      requires sophisticated strategies to protect everyone's interests. This comprehensive guide reveals how 
      to structure your estate to honor your new marriage while preserving your children's inheritance and 
      maintaining family harmony.

      In Ontario, your new spouse can elect to receive their Family Law Act entitlement instead of what you 
      leave them in your will. This equalization claim could give them up to half your net family property

      The Matrimonial Home: Ground Zero for Conflict
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      The matrimonial home receives special treatment under Ontario law. Your spouse has automatic rights to 
      possession regardless of ownership, and you cannot exclude it from division even with a marriage contract. 
      This creates unique challenges when children expect to inherit the family home.
