      When Barbara and Richard Chen retired from their teaching careers in Markham last year, they thought 
      their gold-plated pension and $1.2 million in savings meant healthcare costs were covered. Then Barbara 
      needed specialized eye surgery not covered by OHIP ‚Äì cost: $8,000 per eye. Richard's prescription 
      medications, previously covered by their employer plan, now cost $650 monthly. Their dental work, 
      hearing aids, and physiotherapy added another $15,000 annually. "We budgeted $3,000 a year for health 
      costs," Barbara told me, visibly frustrated. "We're spending $35,000, and that's before any serious 
      health issues." Their shock mirrors thousands of Canadian retirees discovering that healthcare in 
      retirement involves significant out-of-pocket expenses despite our universal system. With healthcare 
      inflation running at 7% annually ‚Äì double general inflation ‚Äì and aging baby boomers facing inevitable 
      medical needs, planning for retirement healthcare costs has become as critical as saving for retirement 
      itself. This comprehensive guide reveals exactly what healthcare really costs in retirement and how to 
      ensure medical expenses don't derail your golden years.

      The Bottom Line: Budget for Health
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Healthcare costs in retirement are substantial, inevitable, and rising faster than general inflation. 
      The couples who thrive in retirement aren't those who ignore these costs but those who plan for them. 
      Barbara and Richard Chen, after their initial shock, restructured their retirement plan to include a 
      $250,000 healthcare reserve fund and comprehensive insurance coverage.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-8">
      "We wish someone had told us the real numbers before we retired," Barbara reflects. "We would have worked 
      one more year to build our healthcare fund. Now we're covered for whatever comes, and that peace of mind 
      is priceless."
