      Sarah stared at the back-to-school supply list for her two kids attending school in North York, 
      her stomach tightening. This would be her first September managing school expenses alone since 
      her divorce was finalized in May. Between uniforms, supplies, technology requirements, and 
      extracurricular activities, she was looking at nearly $3,000 in expenses—and that didn't include 
      the ongoing costs throughout the school year. Her ex-husband Mike insisted the basic child support 
      covered everything, but Sarah knew better. For the thousands of newly divorced parents across the 
      Greater Toronto Area facing their first solo back-to-school season in 2025, creating a sustainable 
      budget while navigating co-parenting financial responsibilities has become an essential survival skill.

      The Real Cost of Back-to-School in the GTA: 2025 Edition
    </h2>
    
    <p className="mb-6">
      The Retail Council of Canada reports that Ontario families will spend an average of $700 per 
      child on back-to-school supplies in 2025, up 12% from last year due to inflation. But for 
      divorced parents in Toronto, Mississauga, and surrounding areas, the true costs often exceed 
      these estimates significantly, especially when factoring in the duplication of supplies between 
      two households.

      Many divorced parents mistakenly believe that monthly child support payments cover all

      Creating Your Post-Divorce Back-to-School Budget
    </h2>
    
    <p className="mb-6">
      A well-structured budget is your roadmap to financial stability during the expensive back-to-school 
      season. Here's a comprehensive approach tailored for divorced parents in the GTA.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-3">
      Step 1: Inventory Your Resources
    </h3>
    
    <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-8">
      <li>Monthly child support amount</li>
      <li>Your available savings for school expenses</li>

      <li>Canada Child Benefit payments</li>
      <li>Any education savings (RESP) available</li>

    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-3">
      Step 2: List All Anticipated Expenses
    </h3>

    <div className="bg-yellow-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-600 p-6 mb-8">
      <h3 className="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">💡 Pro Tip: The Master List Strategy</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
        Create a shared spreadsheet with your ex-spouse listing all school expenses. This prevents 
        duplicate purchases and ensures nothing is forgotten. Include columns for:
      </p>
      <ul className="space-y-1 text-gray-700">
        <li>• Item description and quantity needed</li>
        <li>• Estimated cost</li>
        <li>• Who will purchase</li>
        <li>• Section 7 eligible (yes/no)</li>
        <li>• Purchase deadline</li>
        <li>• Actual cost and receipt tracking</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-3">
      Step 3: Prioritize and Phase Purchases
    </h3>
    
    <p className="mb-4">
      Not everything needs to be purchased before the first day of school:
    </p>

    <ol className="space-y-4 text-gray-700 mb-8">
      <li>
        <strong>Week 1 Essentials:</strong> Basic supplies, backpack, lunch bag, first week outfits
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Month 1 Additions:</strong> Full wardrobe, extra supplies, activity registrations
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Term 1 Completion:</strong> Winter clothing, technology upgrades, special equipment
