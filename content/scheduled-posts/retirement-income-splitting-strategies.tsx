      "We're paying $42,000 in taxes on our retirement income, but my wife's tax bill is only $8,000," 
      complained Richard Patel during our consultation in North York. "There has to be a better way." 
      Indeed there was. After implementing pension income splitting strategies, the Patels reduced their 
      combined tax bill by $14,500 annually‚Äîmoney that now funds their grandchildren's RESPs and winter 
      escapes to Florida. Income splitting isn't just a tax technique; it's a powerful tool that can 
      transform your retirement lifestyle. In 2025, with Ontario's tax rates reaching 53.53% at the highest 
      bracket, strategic income splitting has become essential for Toronto couples seeking to maximize their

      Understanding Pension Income Splitting: The Basics That Save Thousands
    </h2>
    
    <p className="mb-6">
      Pension income splitting allows Canadian couples to allocate up to 50% of eligible pension income to 
      their spouse or common-law partner for tax purposes. This isn't income sharing‚Äîit's a tax strategy 
      that recognizes retirement income as a family resource while respecting individual tax obligations.
    </p>

    <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-600 p-6 mb-8">
      <h3 className="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">üìã Eligible Income for Splitting at Age 65+</h3>
      <ul className="space-y-2 text-gray-700">
        <li>‚Ä¢ <strong>RRIF withdrawals:</strong> All payments from your RRIF</li>
        <li>‚Ä¢ <strong>Life annuity payments:</strong> From RRSPs or pension plans</li>
        <li>‚Ä¢ <strong>Registered pension plan:</strong> Monthly pension payments</li>
        <li>‚Ä¢ <strong>DPSP payments:</strong> Deferred profit sharing plans</li>
        <li>‚Ä¢ <strong>Foreign pensions:</strong> Qualifying foreign retirement income</li>
        <li>‚Ä¢ <strong>NOT eligible:</strong> CPP, OAS, or TFSA withdrawals</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p className="mb-6">
      The age threshold matters significantly. Before age 65, only certain pension income qualifies. After 65, 
      the doors open wide, including RRIF and annuity income. This creates strategic planning opportunities 
      for couples approaching retirement.
