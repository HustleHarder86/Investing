  {
    question: "How much do I need to retire comfortably in the GTA?",
    answer: "Retirement needs vary, but GTA retirees typically require 60-70% of pre-retirement income in 2025. With average Toronto housing costs, a couple needs $75,000-$100,000 annually for comfortable retirement, or $50,000-$65,000 if mortgage-free. Using the 4% withdrawal rule, this requires $1.25-2.5 million in savings. Government benefits (CPP, OAS) provide about $30,000-40,000 per couple, meaning personal savings must generate $35,000-70,000 annually. Healthcare, travel, and inflation significantly impact these figures."
  },
  {
    question: "When should I convert my RRSP to a RRIF?",
    answer: "You must convert RRSPs to RRIFs by December 31 of the year you turn 71, but can convert earlier for strategic reasons in 2025. Early conversion provides income flexibility and pension income splitting at 65. However, RRIF withdrawals are mandatory (5.28% at 71, increasing annually to 20% at 95), while RRSPs allow withdrawal control. Consider early conversion if you need regular income, want to income split, or have large RRSPs that will trigger OAS clawback. Delay if you have other income sources and want maximum tax deferral."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I minimize taxes in retirement?",
    answer: "Strategic tax planning can save retirees thousands annually. Key strategies include: TFSA maximization ($7,000/year, tax-free growth), pension income splitting (up to 50% with spouse), timing RRSP/RRIF withdrawals to smooth tax brackets, delaying CPP/OAS if you have other income, using dividend tax credits from non-registered investments, and managing income to avoid OAS clawback (starts at $86,912 in 2025). Consider professional tax planning - the savings often exceed advisory fees by 5-10x."

      "Asking for a prenup destroyed my first engagement," Robert Zhang told me, sitting in my downtown Toronto 
      office with his fianc√©e Emma. "But not having one destroyed my first marriage." At 42, Robert brought 
      $3.2 million in tech company equity and a paid-off Forest Hill home into his second marriage. Emma, 38, 
      a successful marketing executive, had her own $800,000 investment portfolio and a thriving consultancy. 
      Both had children from previous relationships and elderly parents who might need support. Unlike Robert's 
      first approach ‚Äì springing a lawyer-drafted prenup two weeks before the wedding ‚Äì this time they came 
      together, viewing the agreement as a joint financial planning exercise rather than a prediction of failure. 
      Their story reflects a growing trend in the GTA: prenuptial agreements have increased 73% since 2020, 
      driven by later marriages, blended families, and soaring real estate values. With the average Toronto 
      home now worth $1.2 million and divorce rates at 38%, couples increasingly recognize that love and 
      financial planning aren't mutually exclusive. This comprehensive guide reveals how modern couples use 
      prenuptial agreements not as weapons but as tools for transparency, protection, and ironically, 
      strengthening their relationships through honest financial communication.

      Ontario's Legal Framework: What Prenups Can and Can't Do
    </h3>

    <p className="mb-6">
      In Ontario, prenuptial agreements (formally called "marriage contracts") are governed by the Family Law 
      Act. While powerful tools, they have limitations. Courts can override provisions dealing with children, 
      unconscionable terms, or agreements signed under duress. Understanding these boundaries is crucial for 
      creating enforceable agreements.

      <ol className="space-y-3 text-gray-700">
        <li>
          <strong>1. No Independent Legal Advice (ILA):</strong> Both parties must have separate lawyers

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2. Inadequate Financial Disclosure:</strong> Hiding assets or undervaluing property 
          voids the agreement. Full sworn financial statements required.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>3. Timing Pressure:</strong> Agreement signed too close to wedding (less than 30 days) 
          suggests duress. "Sign or wedding is off" = unenforceable.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>4. Unconscionable Terms:</strong> Leaving spouse destitute while keeping millions. 
          Courts require basic fairness.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>5. Material Changes:</strong> Agreement from 20 years ago doesn't reflect current

      Robert and Emma signed their prenup four months before their wedding. The process brought them closer,
