      "I thought 50/50 custody meant no child support," David Chen said, staring at his financial statement 
      showing $2,400 monthly payments despite equal parenting time. His ex-wife Lisa earned $65,000 as a 
      teacher while David's tech sales role brought in $145,000. Their three children ‚Äì ages 8, 12, and 14 ‚Äì 
      split time equally between their Markham home and Lisa's Scarborough townhouse. Yet David discovered 
      that shared custody doesn't mean shared costs when there's income disparity. Between child support, 
      Section 7 expenses for hockey and tutoring, maintaining two child-ready homes, and the hidden costs of 
      constant transitions, their "amicable" custody arrangement was costing David $58,000 annually ‚Äì far more 
      than the full-custody support he'd initially feared. This financial shock reverberates across the GTA, 
      where custody arrangements dramatically impact not just children's lives but parents' financial futures. 
      With Ontario's child support guidelines, tax implications, and extraordinary expenses creating a complex 
      web of obligations, understanding the true cost of different custody models becomes essential for 
      financial planning. This comprehensive guide reveals how custody decisions translate into decades of 
      financial commitments and how to structure arrangements that protect both children's needs and parents' 
      financial stability.

      The 40% Threshold: Why Every Day Counts
    </h3>

    <p className="mb-6">
      In Ontario, the magic number is 40% ‚Äì or 146 days annually. Once a parent has children 40% of the time, 
      child support calculations shift from the simple table amount to a complex set-off formula. This can 
      reduce support obligations by 30-50%, making the difference between 39% and 40% worth thousands monthly.
