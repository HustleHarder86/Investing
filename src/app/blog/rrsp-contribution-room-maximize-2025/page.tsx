      When John Martinelli, a 48-year-old software architect from Mississauga, finally logged into his CRA 
      My Account last month, he nearly fell off his chair. Sitting there, unused and accumulating since 2015, 
      was $47,000 in RRSP contribution room. "I had no idea," he admitted. "That's potentially $21,000 in tax 
      refunds I've been leaving on the table." John's not alone ‚Äì the average Canadian has $35,000 in unused 
      RRSP room, and for high-income earners in the Greater Toronto Area, that number often exceeds $75,000. 
      With the 2025 RRSP deadline approaching on March 3rd and Ontario's top marginal tax rate hitting 53.53%, 
      understanding and maximizing your contribution room isn't just smart planning ‚Äì it's essential for keeping 
      more of your hard-earned money away from the CRA and building the retirement you deserve.
