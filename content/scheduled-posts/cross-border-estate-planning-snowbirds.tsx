const blogFAQs = [
  {
    question: "What taxes apply to inheritances in Canada?",
    answer: "Canada has no inheritance tax, but estates face deemed disposition tax on capital gains in 2025. All assets (except those passing to a spouse) are deemed sold at fair market value upon death, triggering capital gains tax in the final return. RRSPs/RRIFs are fully taxable as income unless transferred to a spouse or dependent child. Primary residences remain tax-exempt. Probate fees in Ontario are 1.5% on estates over $50,000. Proper planning using trusts, insurance, and spousal rollovers can save hundreds of thousands in taxes."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does probate take in Ontario?",
    answer: "Ontario probate typically takes 3-6 months for simple estates, or 8-18 months for complex situations in 2025. The process includes: application preparation (2-4 weeks), court review and approval (6-8 weeks), asset collection and debt payment (3-6 months), and final distribution (1-2 months). Estates with foreign assets, business interests, or litigation can take 2-3 years. Probate can be avoided for assets with named beneficiaries (RRSPs, TFSAs, insurance) or jointly-held property."
  },
  {
    question: "What are an executor's responsibilities and liabilities?",
    answer: "Executors have fiduciary duty to act in beneficiaries' best interests, facing personal liability for mistakes in 2025. Key responsibilities include: securing assets, paying debts and taxes, filing final tax returns, obtaining probate if required, managing investments prudently, and distributing according to the will. Executors can be personally liable for unpaid taxes, premature distributions, investment losses from poor decisions, and breach of fiduciary duty. Professional executor insurance and legal guidance are strongly recommended for estates over $500,000."

      Robert and Linda had spent fifteen winters in their Naples, Florida condo, living the quintessential 
      Canadian snowbird dream. But when Robert passed suddenly last March, Linda discovered their 
      cross-border estate planning gaps would cost their family over $400,000 in unnecessary taxes and 
      legal fees. Their story isn't unique—with over 500,000 Canadian snowbirds owning U.S. property and 
      millions more holding U.S. investments, the complexity of cross-border estate planning has never been 
      more critical. As we approach October 2025, recent changes to both Canadian and U.S. tax laws, 
      combined with fluctuating exchange rates and evolving treaty interpretations, demand a fresh look 
      at snowbird estate strategies.

      The Double Tax Trap: Understanding Your Exposure
    </h2>
    
    <p className="mb-6">
      Canadian snowbirds face potential taxation in both countries upon death, creating a complex web of 
      obligations that can devastate family wealth. While tax treaties provide some relief, they don't 
      eliminate the burden—they merely coordinate it. Understanding your actual exposure is the first 
      step toward effective planning.

      The Canada-U.S. Tax Treaty: Your Shield and Sword
    </h2>
    
    <p className="mb-6">
      The tax treaty between Canada and the United States provides crucial protections for snowbirds, 
      but claiming these benefits requires careful planning and proper documentation. The treaty's 
      provisions have been tested through recent court cases, providing clearer guidance on their 
      application.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Unified Credit Provision</h3>
    <p className="mb-6">
      Canadian residents can claim a pro-rated portion of the U.S. estate tax exemption based on the 
      ratio of U.S. assets to worldwide assets. For example, if U.S. assets represent 30% of your 
      worldwide estate, you can claim 30% of the $13.61 million exemption, or approximately $4.08 million.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Marital Credit</h3>
    <p className="mb-6">
      The treaty provides an additional marital credit when property passes to a surviving spouse who is 
      a Canadian resident. This effectively doubles the available exemption for married couples, but 
      requires specific planning to maximize the benefit.

      State-Level Complications: Beyond Federal Taxes

    <p className="mb-6">
      While Florida remains tax-friendly with no state estate tax, other popular snowbird destinations 
      impose additional layers of taxation. Understanding state-specific rules is crucial for comprehensive

      Probate Nightmares: Dual Court Proceedings
    </h2>
    
    <p className="mb-6">
      Beyond taxes, snowbirds face the prospect of probate proceedings in both countries. U.S. probate 
      for non-residents can be particularly onerous, often requiring local legal representation and 
      taking 12-18 months to complete.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Consider the Morrison estate: Their $800,000 Florida condo required ancillary probate in Miami-Dade 
      County, costing $35,000 in legal fees and taking 14 months to transfer to beneficiaries. Meanwhile, 
      their Canadian assets were distributed within 6 months. This dual-track process created family 
      stress and significant additional expense.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      Strategic Planning Tools for Snowbirds
    </h2>
    
    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">1. Cross-Border Revocable Trusts</h3>
    <p className="mb-6">
      Establishing a U.S. revocable trust to hold U.S. property can eliminate U.S. probate while maintaining 
      tax neutrality. These trusts must be carefully structured to avoid Canadian attribution rules and 
      maintain principal residence exemption eligibility.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">2. Canadian Holding Corporations</h3>
    <p className="mb-6">
      Some snowbirds use Canadian corporations to hold U.S. real estate, converting U.S.-situs real property 
      into Canadian corporate shares. However, this strategy faces increased IRS scrutiny and may trigger 
      FIRPTA withholding requirements.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">3. Cross-Border Partnerships</h3>
    <p className="mb-6">
      Limited partnerships with Canadian general partners and U.S. limited partners can provide liability 
      protection while potentially reducing estate tax exposure. Recent private letter rulings have 
      clarified acceptable structures.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">4. Non-Recourse Mortgages</h3>
    <p className="mb-6">
      Maintaining substantial non-recourse debt on U.S. property reduces its net value for estate tax 
      purposes. This strategy requires careful structuring to ensure the debt qualifies for deduction.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      Life Insurance: The Ultimate Estate Tax Solution
    </h2>
    
    <p className="mb-6">
      For snowbirds with significant U.S. estate tax exposure, life insurance provides liquidity to pay 
      taxes without forcing asset sales. Policies should be owned by irrevocable trusts to keep proceeds 
      out of the taxable estate.
    </p>

    <div className="bg-indigo-50 border-l-4 border-indigo-600 p-6 mb-8">
      <h3 className="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">💡 Insurance Planning Considerations</h3>
      <ul className="space-y-2 text-gray-700">
        <li>• Calculate maximum potential tax exposure in both countries</li>
        <li>• Consider joint last-to-die policies for married couples</li>
        <li>• Use Canadian insurance to avoid U.S. estate inclusion</li>
        <li>• Structure ownership through trusts for creditor protection</li>
        <li>• Review coverage as property values and tax laws change</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      Income Tax Considerations: The Ongoing Burden
    </h2>
    
    <p className="mb-6">
      Estate planning for snowbirds extends beyond death taxes to ongoing income tax obligations. Rental 
      income from U.S. property, investment income, and potential deemed disposition issues require 
      year-round attention.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Rental Property Complications</h3>
    <p className="mb-6">
      Snowbirds renting their U.S. property face 30% withholding tax on gross rents unless they file 
      Form W-8ECI and elect net rental income treatment. This election requires annual U.S. tax filings 
      but often results in lower overall tax.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Sale of U.S. Property</h3>
    <p className="mb-6">
      FIRPTA requires 15% withholding on the gross sale price of U.S. real estate sold by non-residents. 
      While refunds are available if actual tax is lower, the cash flow impact can be significant. 
      Withholding certificates can reduce the upfront burden but require advance planning.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      The Substantial Presence Test: Avoiding Resident Status
    </h2>
    
    <p className="mb-6">
      Snowbirds must carefully monitor their U.S. days to avoid becoming U.S. tax residents. The substantial 
      presence test's complexity increases with frequent cross-border travel and extended family visits.
    </p>

    <div className="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-600 p-6 mb-8">
      <h3 className="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">⚠️ Day Count Formula</h3>
      <ul className="space-y-2 text-gray-700">
        <li>• Current year days × 1</li>
        <li>• Plus: Prior year days × 1/3</li>
        <li>• Plus: Second prior year days × 1/6</li>
        <li>• If total ≥ 183 days = U.S. tax resident (unless closer connection exception applies)</li>
        <li>• Maximum safe harbor: 121 days in current year (assuming similar prior years)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      Power of Attorney: Critical but Often Overlooked
    </h2>
    
    <p className="mb-6">
      Snowbirds need powers of attorney valid in both countries. A Canadian POA may not be recognized 
      by U.S. financial institutions or government agencies, potentially freezing assets when they're 
      needed most.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Best practice involves executing separate POAs in each jurisdiction, ensuring they don't conflict 
      and explicitly authorize cross-border transactions. Florida's recent POA law changes require 
      specific language for real estate transactions.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      Healthcare Directives: Medical Wishes Across Borders
    </h2>
    
    <p className="mb-6">
      Medical emergencies don't respect borders. Snowbirds need healthcare directives recognized in both 
      countries, addressing different legal standards and medical practices. Ontario's substitute 
      decision-maker hierarchy differs from Florida's healthcare surrogate priorities.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      Currency Risk in Estate Planning
    </h2>
    
    <p className="mb-6">
      Exchange rate fluctuations significantly impact cross-border estates. A U.S. property purchased 
      when the Canadian dollar was at par may now represent a much larger portion of the estate, 
      potentially triggering unexpected tax liability.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Strategic considerations include maintaining U.S. dollar life insurance for U.S. tax obligations, 
      timing of asset sales relative to exchange rates, and potentially hedging currency exposure for 
      large estates.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">
      Recent Legislative Changes and Proposals
    </h2>
    
    <p className="mb-6">
      The U.S. estate tax exemption is scheduled to sunset in 2026, potentially dropping to $5 million 
      (indexed for inflation). This would dramatically increase snowbird estate tax exposure. Meanwhile, 
      Canada's proposed changes to capital gains inclusion rates affect the Canadian-side tax on U.S. 
      property appreciation.
    </p>

    <div className="bg-purple-50 border-l-4 border-purple-600 p-6 mb-8">

      Common Snowbird Estate Planning Mistakes
    </h2>
    
    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Mistake 1: Joint Ownership with Children</h3>
    <p className="mb-6">
      Adding children to U.S. property titles can trigger gift tax filing requirements, expose property 
      to children's creditors, and complicate capital gains calculations. The IRS doesn't recognize 
      Canadian-style "resulting trusts."
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Mistake 2: DIY Will Drafting</h3>
    <p className="mb-6">
      Using online will services or attempting to draft cross-border wills without professional help 
      often creates conflicts between documents, invalid provisions, and missed planning opportunities.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Mistake 3: Ignoring State Law Differences</h3>
    <p className="mb-6">
      Each U.S. state has unique laws affecting property ownership, probate procedures, and creditor 
      rights. What works in Florida may fail in Arizona.

      Conclusion: Proactive Planning Preserves Wealth
    </h2>
    
    <p className="mb-6">
      Cross-border estate planning for snowbirds requires navigating complex, sometimes contradictory, 
      legal systems. But with proper planning, the snowbird lifestyle needn't create estate nightmares 
      for your family.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      Remember Robert and Linda from our introduction? Had they implemented a proper cross-border estate 
      plan—including a U.S. revocable trust, treaty elections, and coordinated wills—their family could 
      have saved hundreds of thousands in taxes and fees while avoiding months of legal complications.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-6">
      As October 2025 approaches and snowbirds prepare for another season in the sun, there's no better 
      time to review and update your cross-border estate plan. The complexity demands professional guidance, 
      but the peace of mind and financial savings justify the investment.
